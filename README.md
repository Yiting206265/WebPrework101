## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

##  Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps

1. Instagram
- Changing the background color of the messages screen
- Deleting old messages

2. Snapchat
- The story feature allows people to share the moments in real life
- The map feature allows people to share location in real time

3. Spotify
- Tailored playlists and daily mixes based on listening habits
- Download content for use offline

4. Trello
- Action boards for task tracking and management
- Real-time updates and task assignments for team projects and collaborations.

##  Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

Iâ€™d like to create a lifestyle app designed to help users build and maintain healthy habits and diets with a focus on simplicity and encouragement. The app would feature a clean, minimalist interface for tracking progress and staying motivated without overwhelming users with unnecessary complexity. Key features would include tools for managing elimination diets and a user-friendly habit tracker that adapts to individual input. To make the experience more engaging, the app would incorporate charming minimalistic characters, such as a penguin, to help track water and vitamin intake, adding a fun and supportive element to achieving health goals.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
None
